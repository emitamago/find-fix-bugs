## ABOUT THS PROJECT
Given working app along with passing tests.
Our task was to find 6 bugs and security issue in the app.

This project was very enjoyable to me because I really interested in how to find 
and fix bug effectively.

I started with running covereage on tests that were given and determined which part of code were not tested.
After that, read test carefully and add some test that will test code which did not get tested on.

One challenge I faced was one passing test was written in the way to pass different criteria that should have tested.
It was hard to find at first, but I successfully find the bug in test and fix it.

This project can showcase my passion to fix bugs effectively and write test correctly
